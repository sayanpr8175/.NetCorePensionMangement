### Made this app in 2021 with friend (see contributor)
### Documentation was not added at that time as it was like a personal trial error project (mostly unplanned). I regret not making the documentation at that timeðŸ˜­

### Here are the snapshot of the application. The backend (in the left) is served through REST API services.
### The MVC (in right side of the image) is consuming the REST API services and users are able to interact with the application through MVC side.
