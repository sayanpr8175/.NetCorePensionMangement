### Made this Pension management app in 2021 with a friend (see contributors)
##### Documentation was not added then as it was like a personal trial-error project (mostly unplanned). I regret not making the documentation at that timeðŸ˜­

##### Here is the snapshot of the application. The backend (on the left) is served through REST API services.
##### The MVC (on the right side of the image) consumes the REST API services, and users can interact with the application through the MVC.
